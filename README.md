# ⚙️ Process Scheduling Simulator

The Process Scheduling Simulator is a Python-Tkinter based tool that visually demonstrates CPU scheduling algorithms like FIFO, Round Robin, and LRSF. It shows process execution with burst times, start/end points, and real-time animation for better understanding of scheduling behavior.

A Python-Tkinter based GUI that visually demonstrates CPU scheduling algorithms such as **FIFO**, **Round Robin**, and **LRSF**.

### Features
- Real-time animation of process scheduling
- Displays Burst Time, Start & End points
- Interactive GUI with OOP-based modular design

### Run
```bash
python simulator.py
