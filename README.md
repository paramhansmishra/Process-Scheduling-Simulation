# Process-Scheduling-Simulation
The Process Scheduling Simulator is a Python-Tkinter based tool that visually demonstrates CPU scheduling algorithms like FIFO, Round Robin, and LRSF. It shows process execution with burst times, start/end points, and real-time animation for better understanding of scheduling behavior.
